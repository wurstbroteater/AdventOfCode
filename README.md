# Advent of Code

This folder contains my solutions for the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) (AOC) adventures.

I've started this fascinating challenge in 2021 while studying for my master's degree. In 2023, I've decided to upload
only the example inputs from the daily tasks and not the personalized puzzle.

**Warning**: Some code may not be commented, idiomatic, optimized or considered readable. Viewer discretion is advised.
